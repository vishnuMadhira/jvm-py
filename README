# JVM-py

A minimal JVM class file parser written in Python, built from first principles by decoding raw `.class` file bytes according to the JVM specification.

## Current Status

**v0.1** — Parses JVM class file header:

- Magic number (`0xCAFEBABE`)
- Minor version
- Major version

Output is verified against `javap -verbose`.

## Motivation

This project is a learning-oriented JVM model to deeply understand:

- Binary file parsing
- Endianness and bitwise operations
- JVM class file structure
- Stack-based virtual machine concepts

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Java JDK (for `javac` and `javap`)

## Usage


## Roadmap

- v0.2: Parse constant pool entries
- v0.3: Parse methods and fields
- v0.4: JVM stack frame model
- v0.5: Bytecode interpreter loop

```bash
javac Hello.java
python read_class.py
```
