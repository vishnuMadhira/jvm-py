# JVM-py

A minimal JVM class file parser written in Python, built from first principles by decoding raw `.class` file bytes according to the JVM specification.

## Current Status

**v0.1** — Parses JVM class file header:

- Magic number (`0xCAFEBABE`)
- Minor version
- Major version

Output is verified against `javap -verbose`.

**v0.2** — Parses constant pool entries including Class, Utf8, Methodref, NameAndType.
Outputs verified against `javap -verbose`.

**v0.3** — Constant pool resolution.

The project now:

- Parses JVM constant pool entries
- Resolves symbolic references (Class, NameAndType, Methodref)
- Produces human-readable JVM signatures such as:
  java/lang/Object.<init>()V
  Output is verified against `javap -verbose`.

## Motivation

This project is a learning-oriented JVM model to deeply understand:

- Binary file parsing
- Endianness and bitwise operations
- JVM class file structure
- Stack-based virtual machine concepts

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Java JDK (for `javac` and `javap`)

## Usage

```bash
javac Hello.java
python read_class.py
```

## Roadmap

- v0.4: Stack frame and operand stack model
- v0.5: Bytecode execution loop (iconst, iload, iadd, istore)
- v0.6: Method invocation and return handling
